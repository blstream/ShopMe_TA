Feature: PRODPFIP-152 Specify requirements to searching functionality
  As a user I want to be able to search the service so that I can see search results

  Scenario: Attempt to search for a phrase longer than 30 characters
    Given I navigate to the main page
    When I try to fill in search field with 31 characters
    Then I should see in search field exactly 30 characters

  Scenario: Attempt to search for a phrase shorter than 2 characters
    Given I navigate to the main page
    And I enter a searching phrase "X" into the search field
    Then the search button is not clickable

  Scenario Outline: Positive flow of searching - searching phrase must have minimum 2 and maximum 30 characters
    Given that there are no services added
    And I add services "<title>", "<category>", "<user_name>", "<email>", "<phone>", "<user_info>", "<basic_info>", "<basic_price>", "<extended_info>", "<extended_price>", "<extra_info>", "<extra_price>"
    When I navigate to the main page
    And I enter a searching phrase "<searching_phrase>" into the search field
    And I click the search button
    Then search results are visible

    Examples:
      | searching_phrase               | title | category | user_name | email           | phone     | user_info | basic_info | basic_price | extended_info | extended_price | extra_info | extra_price |
